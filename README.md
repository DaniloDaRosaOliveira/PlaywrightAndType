Hello, 
I created this project to learn more about Playwright and TypeScript.

The files with the tests are inside the 'tests' folder:
api.spec.ts are a few examples of API tests.
demoQAUI.spec.ts are the E2E tests using the demoQA site.
example.spec.ts are the first tests.

The objects are inside the 'pages'.
You can also find the utils as common functions.
The results of the tests are included in the playwright report.

Please, feel free to reach out to me for any questions or suggestions.
